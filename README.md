# One-Time Password (OTP)

## Front end Angular web app

#### [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password)

The idea came from an interview where I've had to make such an web app without a framework.

Please, review and the [back end PHP Rest API](https://github.com/koredalin/phone-number-validator/).

### Used technologies
* node.js,
* Angular CLI,
* Bootstrap /CSS library/.
